## Getting and Cleaning Data Project


### Abstract
Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

### Source Data
The data are collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

[The source data for this project can be found here.](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

### Data Set Information
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

### Attribute Information
For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

### Section 0. Download, unzip and read data into tables : Packages required (data, utils, data.table)
    Data Source : https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
    Destination ./data/UCI HAR Dataset
    Files :  - features.txt
             - activity_labels.txt
             - subject_train.txt
             - x_train.txt
             - y_train.txt

             - x_test.txt
            - y_test.txt
### Section 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Merge data set result

| subjectId     	| activityId 	| V1,V2 .. 	|
|---------------	|------------	|----------	|
| subject_train 	| Y_train    	| X_train  	|
| subject_test  	| Y_test     	| X_test   	|


Assign column names.

## Section 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Use the function grepl to extract from features rows containing the pattern "mean() or std() others.
Subset this data to keep only variables "measurements on the mean and standard deviation"

## Section 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Merge data subset with the activity_labels table to add the activity names
The shared columns used to merge the data.tables is activityId

## Section 4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names.
Use gsub function for pattern replacement to clean up the data labels.

## Section 5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
Data are stored in data.table
Use package(dplyr)
group data by subjectID, activityId, activityName
Summarise to createthe the average of each veriable for each activity and subject
